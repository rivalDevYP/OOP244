Reflection Question

Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before
doing anything else?
	One of the steps that the copy assignment operator uses to copy the data is to deallocate the destination memory before copying over the source's data to the destination. If you end up copying over the object back to the same object, you can result in data loss, as the object's member will be allocated. A way to prevent this is to check to self assignment, as in, you check to make sure you are not copying over the same object back to itself.
